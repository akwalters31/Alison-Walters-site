  ## About me

  Virginia Tech student majoring in Environmental Informatics in Spring of 2021. I love 
  learning; anything from coding to identifying trees!
content: >
  ### I love data analytics and the environment. 

  My major allows me to gain a wide variety of skills from business information technology, 
  data analytics, to dendrology (the study of trees). When I am not in school I am either 
  working for my internship at Steampunk, reading a memoir, or watercoloring. I am looking 
  for a full time position starting Summer 2021 that will allow me to garner skills 
  related to data science and analytics through programming in R.
